	<p>Very soon, cars with an internal combustion engine (ICE) will be replaced by electric vehicles, which, although they have outstanding dynamic characteristics, are absolutely silent and do not have exhaust sound, which makes them boring. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>Engineers of the German automaker Porsche drew attention to this problem and developed an exhaust system specifically for the next generation of the Porsche Taycan sports electric car. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>In fact, this will not be an exhaust system as such, but will be an imitation of it. That is, an electric car will look very similar to real exhaust pipes, but instead of exhaust gases, the exhaust sound will come out of them. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>Powerful speakers will be located inside such exhaust pipes, which will actually reproduce the exhaust sound synchronized with the accelerator pedal using the appropriate software. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>Porsche engineers believe that electric cars with such a fake exhaust system will not only be less boring, but also safer, since the sound of the exhaust will inform pedestrians about the approaching electric car. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>So far, only the second-generation Porsche Cayman electric car is planned to be equipped with such an exhaust system, but if it proves itself well, then other models of Porsche electric vehicles will be equipped with it.
