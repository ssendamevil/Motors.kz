	<p>Very soon, the updated fourth generation (D5) of the luxury German Audi A8 car will be on sale, which premiered back in November 2021.</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>Against this background, we decided to tell you some interesting facts about this car and what is new in it. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>And so, in addition to the fact that the car has changed a little externally, it has been equipped with new headlights, each of which contains 1.3 million micro mirrors. These mirrors are able not only to direct the luminous flux in the right direction, but also to generate animation, as well as to project various pictograms on the road surface.

	<br> 
	<p>Since the Audi A8 has always been a car for passengers, the main changes in the interior were made for them. Now the passengers in the back row have a large enough refrigerator designed for two bottles, for example champagne, and so that they don't get bored on the road, they can enjoy watching their favorite movie, for which a 10.1-inch screen is installed in front of each passenger.</p>

	<br> 
	<p>Also, passengers can control not only the settings of the climate system, but also the multimedia system, independently choosing the content that they like, and not the driver. Moreover, a special footrest with massage function is provided for all passengers, including the passenger in the front row. How do you like that?
