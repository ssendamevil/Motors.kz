	<p>From the second quarter of 2022, the popular German BMW X5 SUV will be produced in China at the German-Chinese joint venture BMW Brilliance. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>However, European, including Russian BMW X5 fans, should not worry about this, since all these SUVs produced in China are intended exclusively for the Chinese market and will not be sold anywhere outside China. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>The fact is that the demand for BMW X5 SUVs in China is so high that the Chinese are buying them up faster than the Germans have time to deliver. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>In particular, during the period from January to September 2021, 700,000 BMW cars were sold in China, most of which are BMW X5 SUVs. This is almost 20% more than in the same period of 2020. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>Therefore, in order to meet the demand, BMW management decided to produce the volumes of BMW X5 SUVs needed for the Chinese market directly in China, which will ultimately be beneficial to both the automaker and buyers. 
	</p> 
	<br> 
	<p>In conclusion, it is worth noting that BMW X5 SUVs are also produced in Thailand, Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Mexico.</p>
