        <p> In 2017, the French automaker Renault and the Chinese automaker Brilliance agreed to cooperate, as a result of which the Renault Brilliance joint venture was founded. </p>
        <p> Under the terms of cooperation, the French provided the Chinese with technology, and they, in turn, produced cars using these technologies. It was planned that the Renault Brilliance joint venture would produce cars under the Renault and Jinbei trademarks, but in the end only the latter was produced. </p>
        <p> Jinbei cars were not in high demand, which is why the Chinese automaker Brilliance gradually acquired debts. As a result, they accumulated in the amount of 52.4 billion. Chinese yuan or 8.2 billion US dollars. </p>

        <p> It goes without saying that the French became uninterested in such cooperation with the Chinese and on December 30, 2021, the partners officially declared bankruptcy of their joint venture. </p>
        <p> Nevertheless, the French automaker Renault has no plans to leave the Chinese market and has been negotiating for a long time to create a new joint venture, but this time with the more successful Chinese automaker Geely. </p>
        <p> It is noteworthy that Renault Brilliance is not the only unsuccessful experience of cooperation between the eminent French automaker and the Chinese. So in April 2020, the French refused to cooperate with the Chinese automaker Dongfeng, which also turned out to be unprofitable. </p>
