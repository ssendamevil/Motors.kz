        <p> Prestige Imports is the largest importer of Lamborghini cars in North America located in the American city of Miami. However, in the Prestige Imports showroom, you can sometimes find other, no less interesting cars, one of which is this Chevrolet Corvette produced in 1964. </p>

        <p> It is obvious that some parts of the car body are completely new and made from scratch, because they are very different from the original ones. This is especially noticeable in the wider wheel arches. In addition, the car has a completely different front bumper and hood, as well as no headlights. In other respects, the rear of the car is also far from the original. </p>

        <p> As for the interior, it hasn't changed much. Yes, it is fresher, but there are no such drastic changes as in the exterior. But they are under the hood, where a clearly new and more modern 8-cylinder V-shaped engine is noticeable. Presumably this is a 5.7-liter Chevrolet LS 6, whose power varies from 385 to 405 horsepower, depending on the modification. </p>

        <p> Unfortunately, there is no more detailed information about this car, but there is information about its cost and it is as much as 399,950 evergreen American dollars. </p>
