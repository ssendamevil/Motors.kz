        <p> At the annual consumer electronics show CES (Consumer Electronics Show) held in the American city of Las Vegas, the German automaker Mercedes-Benz demonstrated the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX concept electric car with a power reserve of 1,000 kilometers. </p>

        <p> Thanks to modern technologies and aerodynamics, German engineers managed to reduce the electric vehicle's power consumption to an incredible 10 kWh per 100 kilometers, which actually made it possible to achieve such a power reserve. In addition, the electric car turned out to be incredibly light. Its mass is only 1,750 kilograms. For comparison, the mass of the Tesla Model S Plaid electric car is 2,215 kilograms. </p>
        <p> It is noteworthy that the Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX electric car is equipped with the same 900-volt battery in terms of volume and power as the Mercedes-Benz EQS 450+ electric car, but the battery of the concept electric car is produced using a new technology developed by the Mercedes-Benz AMG High Performance Powertrain division. Therefore, the new battery turned out to be 50% smaller and 30%, namely 495 kilograms lighter than the old one. </p>

        <br>
        <p> However, the battery is not the only thing that has helped to significantly lighten the electric car. In addition, the electric car is equipped with ultralight wheels made of magnesium alloy and body elements made of carbon fiber. </p>
        <p> The interior of the electric car looks futuristic and is generally made in the traditional style for all modern Mercedes-Benz cars. On the front panel there is a solid 47.5-inch touchscreen with a resolution of 8K, and the interior details themselves are made of recycled plastic and environmentally friendly materials. </p>

        <br>
        <p> As for the technical and dynamic characteristics of the electric car, nothing is known about them yet. It is assumed that it will be rear-wheel drive and, for the sake of energy efficiency, equipped with a single electric motor with a capacity of about 200 horsepower. </p>
        <p> In conclusion, it is worth noting that from the outside, the electric car is completely different from Mercedes-Benz and looks more like something Korean or Chinese. Nevertheless, it is possible that this is also done for the sake of energy efficiency. </p>
